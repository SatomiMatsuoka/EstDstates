# EstDstates
This m-file provides diffusion coefficient estimation using 2-dimensional 
trajectories of Brownian particles such as single fluorescent molecules 
observed under TIRF microscopy. 
The estimation is based on not mean squared displacement but statistic 
distribution of displacement, which enables an estimation of individual 
diffusion coefficients even if the trajectories are heterogeneous. 
The most likely number of diffusion states with different diffusion 
coefficients is suggested based on Akaike Information Criterion. 
It is optional to analyze transition kinetics among the diffusion states.
